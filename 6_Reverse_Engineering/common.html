<h1 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h1>
<p>Working with only the assembler-code can be very hard and frustrating, especially when analyzing complex programs. So it is advised, that you figure out how the program will look in a higher level language than assembler. This may help to find out special behaviors (potential security leaks) or to see what data the program will need to work.</p>
<p>Since developers are aware of reverse engineering, there are some counter-measures. One of them is code-obfuscation, which makes the binary much more complex than the original source code would be.</p>
<p><em>Note: the serialnumber is numerical</em></p>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>Try to figure out what how the c-program of the provided binary would look like. With this you can write a small program to figure out the right serial number.</p>
<p>The usage of this program is <code>./ex1 username serialnumber</code></p>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>Similar to Exercise 1, you have to figure out what how the c-program of the provided binary would look like. But this time code is more complex.</p>
<p>The usage of this program is <code>./ex2 username serialnumber</code></p>
