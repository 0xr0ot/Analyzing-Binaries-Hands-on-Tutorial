# Understanding Algorithms

When analyzing binaries, a very important thing is to know what the code does. For this, you need to load the binary in your preferred analyzation tool and look at the disassembled code. You could also use the integrated debugger, but it should not be needed, since the exercises are not too hard to understand at all.


## Exercise 1

In this exercise, you have to analyze 3 binary files. Try to figure out what the containing function does and for what platform it is for. Also point out the differences.

Hint: they are libraries and the function-header is similar to `int func(int x, int y)`

## Exercise 2

Now we have not only a function, but a program to deal with.

The usage of the program is `./ex2 string1 string2`

## Exercise 3

This is now a more complex program with some function-calls from libraries and from the program itself.

Hint: renaming items is very helpful
