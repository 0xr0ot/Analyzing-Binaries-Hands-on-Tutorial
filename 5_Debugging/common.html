<h1 id="debugging">Debugging</h1>
<p>With the help of a disassembler, it is possible to understand what a binary is doing. But it is sometimes more helpful to see how the program behaves while running. This is where a debugger can be used. With it, you can figure out why a program crashes and look what is in the registers and the memory at a given point of the execution (very helpful to see with which parameters a function is called). It is also possible to step though each single instruction, so it is easier to find out where the error is really happening.</p>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>The provided program makes a small password-check and displays if the input was the right password or not. Try to figure out the right password.</p>
<p>Hint: check the c function-calls and their parameters</p>
<p>The usage of this program is <code>./ex1 password</code></p>

<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>This example crashes when it is executed. Try to figure out where this happens and what error the developer made.</p>
<p>The usage of this program is <code>./ex2</code></p>

<h2 id="exercise-3">Exercise 3</h2>
<p>In this example, the program gets a number as input, does some calculation with it and should exit with the code 0.</p>
<p>However, there are some bugs, which let the program crash, or you may also receive the wrong exit-code. So try to find out which input actually works and returns 0.</p>
<p>The usage of this program is <code>./ex3 number</code></p>
