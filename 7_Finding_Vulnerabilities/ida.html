<h1 id="solutions-for-radare2">Solutions for Radare2</h1>
<p>Each of these exercises contains a common vulnerability, which can be exploited. There are also other solutions to solve the exercises, but we only mention them and concentrate on the unsafe functions used.</p>
<p><em>Note: these exercises could also be solved very easily be brute-forcing the input. But it is sometimes much more clear what is going on when we use a binary analyzation tool for this (especially for more complex binaries).</em></p>
<h2 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at the main-function:</p>
<p><img src="ex1_graph.jpg" alt="ex1 graph" /></p>
<p>The goal of this exercises is that we get the 'WIN' message displayed. The conditional jump for this <code>printf</code> is done when <code>var_4</code> is not <code>0</code>, else the programs exit without printing the message.</p>
<p>What else happens in this function?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we have some initialization</li>
<li>Then the user has to input a pin</li>
<li>Next, a random number is generated in converted to a string</li>
<li>And finally, the pin, which the user entered, is compared to the generated pin and if it is right, <code>var_4</code> is set to <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, we have a 1/10000 chance to guess the string.</p>
<p>Now let's think about what we can do now:</p>
<ol>
<li>initialize <code>var_4</code> to 1</li>
<li>alter the conditional jump to display 'WIN' if we are false (or replace it with a 'NOP' to remove it)</li>
<li>the random generator is not initialized, so the number is always the same -&gt; we could sniff it</li>
<li>perhaps there are some unsafe functions used<br />
Since point 1-3 are trivial to do, we concentrate on point 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>When checking the functions used, we see that <code>gets</code> is an unsafe function, because the buffer size is not checked (-&gt; buffer overflow).</p>
<p>To find out if we can use this we have to take a look at the local variables:</p>
<pre><code>var_30= dword ptr -30h
var_2C= dword ptr -2Ch
var_28= dword ptr -28h
var_17= dword ptr -17h
var_12= dword ptr -12h
var_8= dword ptr -8
var_4= dword ptr -4
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting local variables for us are the buffer (<code>var_12</code>) and the 'token' to pass (<code>var_4</code>). Since we need to overwrite parts of <code>var_4</code>, we have to write at least 15 (10 for the buffer size and 4 because of var_8) characters to the buffer.</p>
<p>Let's test this:</p>
<pre><code>ex1
Enter pin : 
12345678901234
Nope 

ex1
Enter pin : 
123456789012345
Nope 
WIN </code></pre>
<h2 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h2>
<p>There is no solution for exercise 2 yet, but it should be possible to break it with some format-string exploitation, which is explained <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/28476.pdf">here</a></p>
