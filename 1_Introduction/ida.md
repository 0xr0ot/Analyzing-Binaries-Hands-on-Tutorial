Introduction IDA Pro
====================

_The IDA Disassembler and Debugger is an interactive, programmable, extendible, multi-processor disassembler hosted on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. IDA has become the de-facto standard for the analysis of hostile code, vulnerability research and COTS validation. See this executive overview for a summary of its features and uses._

IDA Pro is quiet expensive for a hobby-researcher, but there is an older version of IDA Pro (v5.0), which is available [here](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml). You can also try an evaluation version with some limitation of the most recent version by downloading the installer [here](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml).

_Please note, that some of the exercised could not be done with the free version of IDA Pro, because there is no support for 64bit binaries_

There is an [online manual](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/) and also some [tutorials](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/index.shtml) provided on the homepage.
