<h1 id="introduction-radare2">Introduction Radare2</h1>
<p>A good explanation about Radare2 is in the Radare2 Book, which a free available online <a href="https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/introduction/history.html">here</a>:</p>
<p><em>The radare project began in February of 2006 to provide a free and simple command-line hexadecimal editor with support for 64-bit offsets. The intention was to use the tool to perform searches and help recover data from hard-disks.</em></p>
<p>_Since then, the project has evolved to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries while making use of basic *NIX concepts. Those concepts include the famous &quot;everything is a file,&quot; &quot;small programs that interact using stdin/stdout,&quot; and &quot;keep it simple&quot; paradigms._</p>
<p><em>It is mostly a single-person project. However, ideas and source code contributions are greatly appreciated.</em></p>
<p><em>The central focus of this project is the hexadecimal editor. Additionally, this project contains an assembler/disassembler, code/data analysis and graphing tools, scripting features, easy Unix integration, and more.</em></p>
<p>You can get the most recent version of radare2 <a href="http://radare.org/r/">here</a></p>
