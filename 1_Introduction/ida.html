<h1 id="introduction-ida-pro">Introduction IDA Pro</h1>
<p><em>The IDA Disassembler and Debugger is an interactive, programmable, extendible, multi-processor disassembler hosted on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. IDA has become the de-facto standard for the analysis of hostile code, vulnerability research and COTS validation. See this executive overview for a summary of its features and uses.</em></p>
<p>(citation from <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/overview.shtml">IDA-Homepage</a>)</p>
<p>IDA Pro is quiet expensive for a hobby-researcher, but there is an older version of IDA Pro (v5.0), which is available <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml">here</a>. You can also try an evaluation version with some limitation of the most recent version by downloading the installer <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_demo.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Please note, that some of the exercised could not be done with the free version of IDA Pro, because there is no support for 64bit binaries</em></p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/">online manual</a> and also some <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/tutorials/index.shtml">tutorials</a> provided on the homepage.</p>
