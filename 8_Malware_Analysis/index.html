<p>Malware is a problem which should everyone, who uses a computer, should be aware of and attacks through malware is quiet common now. When you have to deal with malware you have to understand what it does to your system and how you can stop and/or remove it.</p>
<p>Since you usually don't have access to the source code of malware, you have to do a binary analysis. However, the writers of the malware are aware of this and make this task as hard as possible. So expect that on real-life examples, such techniques as packing and obfuscation are common usage. Other techniques like debugger- and sandbox-detection are also very common.</p>
<p>There are several pages on the internet, where you can download malware for testing purposes (real-life ones and also harmless ones for testing). Please be especially careful when dealing with them (use at least an isolated virtual machine)!</p>
<p>Because the analyzation of malware is a very complex and quiet large topic, it would be impossible to cover it in this tutorial. Below there are some links to ressources about learning how to research malware.</p>
