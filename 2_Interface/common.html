<h1 id="interface">Interface</h1>
<p>The interface of a binary analysis tool supports at least the viewing of following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disassembly of the binary</li>
<li>Memory</li>
<li>Registers</li>
</ul>
<p>A command-line interface may be harder to learn (especially for beginners), but it is better suited in environments where no desktop is available (for example embedded devices or ssh connections). Scripting is also easier in such environments.</p>
<p>GUIs give a more convenient working environment, but they may get confusing if there is too many information displayed on screen or the interface is overloaded with different functions. But is much easier to get used to work with a new software if it has a GUI.</p>
